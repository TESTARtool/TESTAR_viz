/** \page How_dash How do Dash applications work?
Dash is a framework based on REACT.JS with a Python API. (R is also being developed)\n
Dash hides javascript  and (flask) server programming requirements from the developer.\n
A collection of Standard components like Button, Input, Table and CytoScape graph can be used by just pure python code.\n
\n
The Dash framework relies heavily on annotations to control the application-logic and browser actions and responses.\n
Business logic and page layout are written in Python code.
The annotations form the 'glue' between the python functions and ensures proper invocation.\n
(Converse: The inner working of the application cannot be fully understood by just reviewing  the python code.)\n
The call graph shown on \ref cg_dash is generated by Dash and can be seen in the browser when starting a Dash application with 'debug=True'\n
\n
For move information on Dash, please visit https://dash.plot.ly/


When a parameter in the documentation  starts with\n
* i_        :this is an input value, supplied by a Dash callback. When Dash detects a change in this value, the Python function is triggered\n
* s_        :this is an state value, supplied by a Dash callback alongside a trigger value to the python function\n
* return    :this is a return values from an annotated functions that is  supplied to the Dash framework.\n

/** \page cg_dash Call Graph generated by DASH.
The call graph can be displayed in the application web page by setting the variable \ref settingdebug "debug" in settings.py to **True**.\n
The debug icon at the bottom-right corner has now an option to show the call graph.\n
Legend:\n
- Gray box:  Object on the Web page\n
- Blue box:  Attribute of an Object\n
- Green circle:  Processing function (Application logic)\n
- Arrow from Blue box to Green circle: Trigger to fire off the processing. Multiple triggers are or-ed\n
- Arrow from Green circle to Blue box: Output of the processing\n
\n
Notes:\n
- besides the trigger, the processing function is also using State information from the web page and Global data structures on the server-side.\n
The latter makes that the application is not multi-user because each browser  tab will read-and-write to the same global data structures.\n
Launching the application on another port will create a new independent process and mitigate the above effect.\n
