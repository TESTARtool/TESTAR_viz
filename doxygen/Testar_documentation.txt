/** \page How_dash How do Dash Application work?
Dash is a framework based on REACT.JS with a Python API. (R is also being developed)\n
Dash hides javascript  and (flask) server programming requirements from the developer.\n
A collection of Standard components like Button, Input, Table and CytoScape graph can be used by just pure python code.\n
\n
For Dash to control the backend application and browser actions and responses,the framework relies heavily on annotations.\n
Business logic and page layout are written in Python code.
The annotations form the 'glue' between the python functions and ensures proper invocation.\n
(Converse: The inner working of the application cannot be fully understood by just reviewing  the python code.)\n
The call graph shown on \ref cg_dash is generated by Dash and can be seen in the browser when starting a Dash application with 'debug=True'\n
\n

When a parameter in the documentation  starts with
* i_        this means that this is an input value, supplied by a Dash callback. When Dash detects a change in this value, the Python function is triggered\n
* s_        this means that this is an state value, supplied by a Dash callback alongside a trigger value to the python function\n
* return    this means that this is a return values from an annotated functions that is  supplied to the Dash framework.\n
